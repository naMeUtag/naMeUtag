# naMeUtag
######A better way to present yourself at various gatherings.
===
naMeUtag is a smart LED nametag built on the MeU. It allows you to customize the way you present yourself at different events. At a Hackathon, instead of being boring "Hello, I'm X", you are ***a UX Designer***, at a concert you are ***a Metallica lover***, while at a basketball game you are ***cheering for the Raptors***. There are endless possibilities and applications for this product. We feel that this allows for better and more comfortable social interaction and eases the task of talking to someone for the first time by bluntly stating what they are interested in.
